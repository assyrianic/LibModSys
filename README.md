# LibModSys
A runtime/plugin-based, inter-plugin communication library for SourceMod.


## Version
1.4.0b


## Purpose
To reduce the boilerplate needed to setup and create forwards and to simplify inter-plugin data sharing and control, all to facilitate good subplugin/module systems for complex server mods/systems.


## Features
* Global Forwards Manager - controlled and managed via Config file.
  - Let's you rapidly create and execute Global Forwards without needing to recompile plugins.

* Private Forward Managers - Any plugin using libmodsys can request one or more private forward managers, each individually controlled by a config file.
  - Let's you rapidly create and execute Private Forwards without needing to recompile plugins.

* Module/Plugin Managers - Any plugin using libmodsys, just like the Private Forward Managers, can request one or more Plugin Managers.

Each type of manager has different strengths to them.


* `SharedMap` - `StringMap` that has extra features to allow for very simple data sharing and data control between plugins.
  - Works on a system of properties.
  - Plugins that make properties, own those properties.
  - Plugins can optionally **[Un]Lock** (prevents other plugin's except `SharedMap` creator/owner plugin from deleting the property) and/or **[Un]Freeze** (prevents other plugin's except `SharedMap` creator/owner plugin from changing the property data).
  - `SharedMap`s are more type safe than normal `StringMap`s and allow you to get the length of an array or string of a property!
  - `SharedMap`s are safe to share and impossible to destroy/clear from other plugins that didn't initialize the `SharedMap`!
  - `SharedMap`s can cache functions and can be invoked via prop of the function and uses an argument parsing string.

## How To Use

### Creating Global Forwards

check out `configs/plugin_manager/global_fwds.cfg` to see an example config file on setting up forwards and modify/add forwards as needed.

Here's a code example, remember that there's only ever _one_ Global Forward manager [pointless to have & manage multiple].
```cs
/// get a global forward object from
/// the forward set up in `configs/plugin_manager/global_fwds.cfg`.
GlobalFwd fwd_example;
LibModSys_GetGlobalFwd("OnGlobalFwdExampleName", fwd_example);

/// starts the global forward call
fwd_example.Start();

	/// push ints.
	fwd_example.PushCell(100);
	fwd_example.PushCell(200);

	/// push string.
	char s2[] = "hello from global fwd";
	fwd_example.PushString(s2, sizeof(s2));

	/// push int as ref.
	int ref1;
	fwd_example.PushCellRef(ref1);

	/// push float as ref.
	float ref2;
	fwd_example.PushFloatRef(ref2);

/// end call and get result.
Action result;
fwd_example.Finish(result);
```


### Creating Private Forwards for a specific Private Forward Manager

check out `configs/plugin_manager/private_fwds_example.cfg` for an _example_ on Private Forward creation. **Remember that each private forward manager requires a cfg file for what private forwards you want, you can use the same cfg file if they will all share the same private forwards**.

Here's example code on creating and using a private forward manager:
```cs
/// the actual manager is dealt with by the plugin-library.
/// you get a manager id to refer to that specific manager.
ManagerID priv_fwd_id = LibModSys_MakePrivateFwdsManager("configs/my_plugin/private_fwds.cfg");

/// using the manager id, we can directly hook to a specific forward!
/// thus saving you alot of boilerplate of having to set up a hook/unhook system!
LibModSys_PrivateFwdHook(priv_fwd_id, "OnPrivFwdExampleName", OnPrivateFwdTest);
```

### Creating Module Managers

check out `configs/plugin_manager/module_manager_example.cfg` for an example on how to setup the operations for specific Module Managers. Module Managers are more useful for cases when global or private forwards aren't enough and/or you need more control of plugins.

```cs
/// like using with private forward managers,
/// module managers are referred to by id.
/// module manager config files let you define what plugins
/// to load either by prefix or manual registration.
ManagerID module_manager_id = LibModSys_MakeModuleManager("configs/my_plugin/module_manager.cfg");

/// if manual registration is demanded.
/// this native will register the plugin that's calling it to a string name id.
LibModSys_RegisterModule(module_manager_id, "subplugin_1");

/// the plugin can also be unregistered.
/// 
LibModSys_UnregisterModule(module_manager_id, "subplugin_1");

...

/// with this, you can grab plugin handles by the module name.
Handle pl = LibModSys_GetModuleHandle(module_manager_id, "subplugin_1");

/// convenience object that helps simplifies forward/function calls a bit.
Callable call;
call.StartFunc(pl, "OnFunc");

int Ints[5];
call.PushArray(Ints, sizeof(Ints));

char Str[] = "top lel";
call.PushString(Str, sizeof(Str));

call.PushNullString();
call.PushNullVec3();

call.PushCell(100/true);

bool|int x;
call.PushCellRef(x);

call.PushFloat(0.5);

float f;
call.PushFloatRef(f);

any result;
call.Cancel(); | call.Finish(result);
```

### `SharedMap` and Data Sharing/Control.
For setting up data sharing and control, You need a core plugin that will setup the `SharedMap` that will be used with all the subplugins/modules that will communicate with the core. What you need to do is to first use the `OnLibraryAdded` forward, specifically checking for if the name is `LibModSys`. There we will create the `SharedMap` under a channel name of your own choosing!

Remember this information though:

* You can use `Lock`, `Unlock`, `Freeze`, and `Unfreeze` to control data security of each property.
* That only the owner plugin of a property can [un]lock and/or [un]freeze said property.
* The plugin that created the `SharedMap` can override any locked and/or frozen properties.
* Newly created properties are locked and frozen by default, only the owner of the property or channel can unlock and unfreeze them.

```cs
public void OnLibraryAdded(const char[] name) {
	if( StrEqual(name, "LibModSys") ) {
		SharedMap shmap = SharedMap("my_plugin");
		
		/// create's a property,
		/// making the creator/owner plugin the owner of this property.
		shmap.SetInt("Example property", 100);
		
		/// New properties are both Locked and Frozen by default.
		/// Unfreeze and/or Unlock properties to allow those
		/// properties to be modified and/or deleted respectively.
		shmap.Unfreeze("Example property");
	}
}
```

With the core plugin having setup the `SharedMap` and the data channel, you're now ready to share data with subplugins/modules that will work with the core plugin.


Like the core plugin, you need to first use the `OnLibraryAdded` forward, specifically checking for if the name is `LibModSys`. However, with a subplugin/module, we need to use `PawnAwait` to create a Timer that'll _wait_ [checks and repeats basically] for the channel that will have the `SharedMap` we need from the core plugin. The function that you give to `PawnAwait` needs to return a `bool`. The timer will stop repeating and close when the function it uses returns `true`. A `false` return value will make the timer repeat again.

```cs
public void OnLibraryAdded(const char[] name) {
	if( StrEqual(name, "LibModSys") ) {
		/// `PawnAwait` is in plugin_utils.inc
		PawnAwait(AwaitChannel, 0.25, {0}, 0);
	}
}

public bool AwaitChannel() {
	if( !LibModSys_ChannelExists("my_plugin") ) {
		return false;
	}
	SharedMap shmap = SharedMap("my_plugin");
	...
	return true;
}
```

It's important to remember that you can use the `SharedMap` map constructor to _retrieve_ a `SharedMap` from a specific channel. Inputing a different channel name [this includes typos] will open a new channel and create a new `SharedMap` for that plugin as the owner. This also allows a plugin dev to have specific and/or _tiered_ `SharedMap`s to be used as the data set for a group of subplugins/modules.


From all of this combined, a general pattern of module systems arises into 3 different categories:


**Component-plugins** are plugins that implement and handle a specific functionality/data independently from other plugins.

**Framework-plugins** are plugins that are basically the skeleton of a set of behaviors/actions.

**System-plugins** are plugins that merge the data/functionality of component-plugins and the behavior of framework-plugins.


An example of this concept is the idea of a store plugin/mod. You have **Money** & **Item** _component-plugins_, a **Store** _framework-plugin_, and a **Menu** _system-plugin_ that connects the Money & Item component-plugins with the Store framework-plugin.
